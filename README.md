# Minesweeper
This is a minesweeper game

## Keyboard shortcut

Flag and unflag the bomb

```bash
shift + left click
```

## Some tricks
Click on a cell that's already being cleared (with #of mines around > 0), if the #of flags around this cell equal to the #of mines around, it will clear all adajacent cells for you.

Enjoy :)
