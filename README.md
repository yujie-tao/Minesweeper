# Minesweeper
This is a minesweeper game in Javascript.

## Keyboard shortcut

Flag and Unflag the bomb

```bash
shift + left click
```

## Some tricks
Click on a cell that's already being cleared (with #of mines around > 0), if #of flags around this cell equals to the #of mines around, you can clear all adjacent cells.
